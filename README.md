# Yet Another Kafka

This project is the final component of the course UE20CS322: Big Data.

# A background to Kafka
Apache Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system and a robust queue that can handle a high volume of data and enables you to pass messages from one end-point to another. Kafka is suitable for both offline and online message consumption. Kafka messages are persisted on the disk and replicated within the cluster to prevent data loss. Kafka is built on top of the ZooKeeper synchronization service. It integrates very well with Apache Storm and Spark for real-time streaming data analysis.

# The Aim and Scope of Our Project
In this venture, we set out to replicate the most important and basic functionality of Apache Kafka.
